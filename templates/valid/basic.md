### Paragraph

The command line is a text-based interface used to run commands on your computer. Youâ€™ll also often see it referred to as the terminal. In this tutorial, weâ€™ll use both interchangeably. Itâ€™s a lot like using the Finder on a Mac or Explorer on Windows. Finder and Explorer are examples of graphical user interfaces (GUI). The command line is a powerful, text-based way to interact with your computer.

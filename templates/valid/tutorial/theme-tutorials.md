Gatsby themes are a new way to encapsulate, re-use, and compose Gatsby functionality.

In this section, you'll find tutorials for:

1. Setting up a site using a single theme (the blog theme)
2. Setting up a site which composes multiple themes (the blog theme, and the notes theme)

To learn more about themes in general, you may be interested to check out the [themes section of the docs](/docs/themes), as well.
